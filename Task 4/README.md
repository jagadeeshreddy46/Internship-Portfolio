# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key analysis performed:

### Regional Sales Analysis

Understanding which regions generate the most revenue.

### Category Profitability

Evaluating which product categories drive profitability.

### Discount Impact

Analyzing how discounts influence profit margins.

### Customer Segment Behavior

Identifying high-value customer segments.

# 🔬 Hypothesis Testing

To statistically validate the effect of discounts on profitability, a **Two-Sample T-Test** was conducted.

**Hypothesis**

H₀: Discounts do not significantly affect profit
H₁: High discounts significantly reduce profit

Results showed:

**p-value < 0.05**

Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected, confirming that **high discounts significantly reduce profitability**.

# 📈 Key Business Insights

* High discounts strongly reduce profit margins.
* Technology products generate the highest profit.
* Some regions generate high sales but lower profits.
* Corporate customers contribute higher revenue per order.

# 💡 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

✔ Limit excessive discounting (above 20%)
✔ Focus on high-margin product categories such as Technology
✔ Investigate operational inefficiencies in low-profit regions
✔ Develop loyalty programs for corporate customers
